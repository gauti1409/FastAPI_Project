---------STARTING STEPS---------------------------

The code below is referred to as the Path Operation or Route. 
1. To make the function act like an API, we will have to use a decorator(@). 
The decorator turns this function into an actual path operation, so that someone who wants to use our API can hit this endpoint.

2. Everytime you make a change to the code, to reflect it on the webpage, you will have to restart the server.

3. To automatically reload the made changes without restarting the server, we will have to use the below command:
"uvicorn main:app --reload". This command can be used for a developer environment but not in the production environment since we won't be 
making changes to the production environment.

4. FastAPI goes through the code and looks for the match in the HTTP and URL in path operations. 
As soon as it gets the first match in the path operations, it will run only the first path operation. 
If there are any other path operations with the same HTTP and URL, then they won't run. 
So the order of path operations is very very important in FastAPI. 

API Endpoint : In summary, an API endpoint is a specific location within an API that accepts requests and sends back responses. 
It’s a way for different systems and applications to communicate with each other, by sending and receiving information and instructions 
via the endpoint.
It allows developers to access data and functionality from other systems, and to create new apps that can easily access and use data and 
functionality from other systems, without having to build everything from scratch.

5. GET Requests are getting data from the API Server whereas a POST request is sending the data to the API Server.

6. Body in POST request is going to extract all the fields from the body and convert it into a python dictionary and it's going to store 
inside a variable name 'payload'.  

7. So, we not only send data in the body within a Postman request, we are also able to extract that data and send it right back to 
the user.

8. In a real application, we would take the data and then we would normally store that data inside our database, 
so that we can create a new post stored in the database. And then, now anytime user tries to retrieve the post, 
we can fetch that data from the DB. 

9. Why we need a Schema:
- It's difficult to extract all the values from the body and extract each one individually.
- The client can send whatever data they want and we don't want user to send arbitrary data.
- To make sure that we get the data validated, whatever data is sent by the user.
- We ultimately want to force the client to send data in a schema that we expect. 
- And the way we want to work with the APIs is, we want to explicitly define what the data should look like, so that the 
frontend can send you exactly what you expect it. 

----------------------------------------------------

-----PYDANTIC INTRO----------------

9. Pydantic is it's own library and has nothing to do with FastAPI. It's is own complete and separate library that we can use  
with any of our Python applications. FastAPI just makes use of it so that we can define a schema.   

10. A Pydantic BaseModel is a class that defines how your data looks like and the validation requirements it needs to pass in order 
to be valid.
For further information see https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/

11. So, we are going to pass the "Post" BaseModel to the path operation "createposts". As a result of this, FastAPI is automatically 
going to validate the data that it receives from the client based off of this model. 

12. In this course, we are going to use the Pydantic models to ensure that the schemas not only receiving data from the front end, 
but also sending data back is all matching up with our organized schema. 

13. We can use model_dump() function to convert the Pydantic model into a dictionary so as to send back the dictionary if we want to.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------INTRO TO CRUD APPLICATION -------------------------

14. This also covers the STANDARD CONVENTIONS required to build an API for a CRUD based application. 

15. CRUD:  Create, Read, Update, Delete

- CREATE: POST

- READ: GET

- UPDATE: PUT/PATCH; 
1. PUT: When we use PUT, we pass all of the information for updating it. So, all of the fields have to be sent to the API server.
2. PATCH: We can just send the specific field that we want to change. 

- DELETE: DELETE 

16. Refer to the screenshot in FastAPI folder naming "CRUD_Operations_diagram" for Standardisation for naming endpoints in an API and 
other details.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

---------IMPLEMENTING A FUNCTION TO RETRIEVE ONE POST----------------

- @app.get("/post/{id}") : The ID field is referred to as "Path Parameter" in API terminology.

- Important Note: Anytime we are passing a path parameter into a function, it is always going to be returned as a string.
We will have to typecast it to convert it into an integer.

- To perform any kind of validation and conversion on the path parameter, for e.g: checking if the input given by user is integer or not 
and if it validates with "id". So, we can perform validation with FastAPI. For eg: "def get_post(id: int):".

So, first FastAPI is going to validate that the input id given by User can be converted to an integer or not. Once it validates, it will
convert it into an integer for us. So, we no longer have to typecast this "id" variable. 
And hence, Frontend will also get a good way of understanding of where they went wrong.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------HOW ORDER MATTERS WITHIN FASTAPI----------------------------------

@app.get("/posts/{id}")
def get_post(id: int):
    post = find_post(id)
    return {"post_detail": post}


@app.get("/posts/latest")
def get_latest_post():
    post = my_posts[len(my_posts)-1]
    return {"post_detail": post}

- The order in FASTAPI works from TOP to BOTTOM.
- In above, if we try to run the "latest" path operation, we will get an error. 
- So, when we send the request, FASTAPI is going to go to all of our paths from top and it's going to find the first match.
- When it checks for the specific path, the request doesn't know which path it has to refer to. So, the first path operations 
it encounters is posts/{id}, which then further tries to validate the input and throws the error as "latest" cannot be converted into an 
integer.
- THIS IS THE EXAMPLE OF WHERE ORDER MATTERS.
- Structure your API in such a way so that it doesn't run into such issues.
- To resolve above issue, just change the order of the functions defined. Put "latest" one above "id" one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------IF AN ID DOESN'T EXIST----------------------------------

- Return the "404 NOT FOUND" statement HTTP Code, if the requested id from user is not found or does not exist.
- We will have to manipulate the Response so as to implement the "404 NOT FOUND" for an unavailable id.

- Raise a HTTP Exception: It is a built in exception into FASTAPI. We can pass the specific error code we want as well as the message.
And in that way, we don't have to hard code any message for this. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------TO DELETE AN ID----------------------------------
- When you delete a particular Id, you will use 204 HTTP Status code to send as a status response code but remember not to send any data
back. 

- Raise a HTTP Exception if there is no valid ID found.

- Try to return the HTTP Response - 204_NO_CONTENT, which is the standard HTTP response for DELETE.

- The delete endpoint will be different from the other endpoints but probably will have the same kind of code getting repeated on my_posts
of the projects. So, remember it clearly.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------DOCUMENTATION OF FAST API----------------------------------

- The documentation of the FASTAPI gets generated automatically and we don't have to worry about updating documentation separately.
- To see the documentation of the written API, just go the link: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
- The above link shows you the built in documentation powered by Swagger UI. 
- So FastAPI has built in swagger UI support, and it automatically generates all of the routes, and documentation for all of your paths.
- We can also test things out using Swagger UI in the built in documentation.
- We can also use the link : http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc. This presents a different format of the FastAPI documentation using redoc.

- Till here we have a basic understanding of how to work with FASTAPI and how to set up basic routes and work with path operations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------DATABASES----------------------------------

- A database is a collection of organized data that can be easily accessed and managed. 
- We never interact with databases directly. Instead we make use of a software referred to as Database Management System(DBMS).
So when we want to perform an operation on a DB, we are going to send that request to a DBMS, that management system is then going
to actually perform that operation, and then it's going to send the result back to us.
- SQL: Langauage used to communicate with DBMS.
- Each instance of Postgrescan be carved into multiple separate databases.

- A table represents a subject or event in an application. 
- Imporatant Note: When you design your database, you need to figure out what are the relationships beforehand between different tables, 
so that we can design a very efficient database. 

- VERY VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: 
When you are working with postgres, especially with an API, where we want to create a new post, like our application, the General
Convention in an API is - Once we create a new post, we want to return that data back to whoever sent that request to the API. 
So we want to get that brand newly created post, with the new fields like created_at fields and all the default values, and send it back 
to the client or the front end.  

So how do we get Postgres to automatically return that post to the front end? 
1. Using SELECT * FROM table statement.
2. INSERT into products(name, price, inventory) VALUES ('car', 10000, 100) RETURNING *
3. insert into fastapi_db.public.products (product_name, price, inventory) 
values ('car', 10000, 100),('laptop',50, 25), ('monitor', 60, 4) 
returning *;


NOTE: In statement 2 above, the RETURNING Keyword returns the newly created item or items, and after the keyword we have to specify
the columns that we want for the newly returned items. Using * returns every single column.

- USING RETURNING WITH DELETE KEYWORD TO SEE WHAT THE DELETING RECORD LOOKED LIKE:
DELETE FROM products WHERE product_id in (10,11) RETURNING *;

--UPDATING RECORDS WITH RETURNING KEYWORD:
UPDATE products SET product_name='flour tortilla', price=40 WHERE product_id = 19 RETURNING *;
update products set is_sale = true where product_id = 5 returning *;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------ESTABLISHING A CONNECTION WITH POSTGRES DATABASE----------------------------------

- A connection to a Database can fail. Potential reasons could be:
1. DB is unreachable or DB is down. 
2. Wrong password etc.

So, to deal with issues where our Python code could potentially fail, we will always cover that patch of code in TRY/EXCEPT Block. 

- We will use the RealDictCursor to get the columns of the tables or keys of the dictionary in the given argument.
RealDictCursor is a specialized DictCursor that enables to access columns only from keys (aka columns name), 
whereas DictCursor enables to access data both from keys or index number.
The main advantage of real dictionary cursor is the easiness to get a query output as json.

- IMPORTANT NOTE: 
There is no point in having our server up and runnning if we cannot access our Database. Whenever we will have our server up,
we will first have to make sure that it is connected to the Database and then the rest of the operations in the script happens.

- FETCHALL: Fetches all the records from the table.
- FETCHONE: Fetches only one record from the table using a specified column. 
NOTE: We can also use FETCHALL for fetching one id, but it will just keep searching through the database for another post with that ID.

- WHILE INSERTING THE DATA USING PYTHON CODE IN SQL DATABASE:(Check create_posts function)
1. We never want to do any kind of string interpolation and then pass in the values of post directly into the query written in 
Python code. Instead, we are going to parameterize or sanitize all the data that we put into the SQL statement.

--VERY VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:
- WHY to use %s method instead of f-string method while writing the INSERT, SELECT SQL queries?
Ans: 
1. f-string method would technically work. But it would make the application vulnerable to SQL INJECTION. The user could try to
exploit the DB using SQL query, if the f-string method is applied, and could manipulate the data within our SQL DB. Thta's why it'same
never good to pass the data directly using f-string method. 

2. A SQL INJECTION attack consists of insertion or "injection" of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application.
A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), 
execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the 
DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system. SQL injection attacks are a type of injection attack, 
in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to affect the execution of predefined SQL commands.

3. The Postgres library, psycopg2, can sanitize the inputs in Python Code for SQL query. So when we use %s method, it will make sure that
no weird SQL Commands are being passed and also makes sure that the app is not vulnerable to SQL injection. 

- Why only %s is used in the query not %d?
Ans: As the whole query needs to be in a string format while execution of query so %s should be used.
After query is executed integer value is retained. See the bookmark saved on this. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERY VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC:

-------OBJECT RELATIONAL MAPPER(ORM)----------------------------------

1. When it comes to working with a DB within a Python application or any app across any language, there's a couple of different ways of 
interacting with the DB.

2. First, we saw how we can use the deafult Postgres Driver to talk to a default Postgres DB by sending SQL Commands.
Since it's easy to use raw SQL, so we can send that directly to Postgres using whatever the default Postgres drivers for your specific
programming language.

3. One of the popular ways of working with the databases is using OBJECT RELATIONAL MAPPER(ORM).

4. ORM is a layer of abstraction that sits between the database and our FAST API application. So, we never talk directly to a database
anymore. Intsead, we talk to the ORM. And then the ORM will actually talk to our database.

5. One of the benefits of using ORM is we don't have to use SQL anymore. Instead of using raw SQL, we will use standard Python code,
calling various functions and methods that alternately translate into SQL themselves. 

6. See ORM Screenshot 1. FastAPI will actually use regular Python code to send specific commands to an ORM. And then the ORM will take
that Python code and convert it into regular SQL, and then using the same database driver that we are using, that is Psycopg2, it will
talk to the DB. And then it will eventually send the result back to us, because DBs can only talk SQL. 

7. See screenshot 2 - What ORMs can do. Instead of manually defining tables in postgres, we can define our tables in Python Modules.
Queries can be made using regular Python code. So we can actually chain on different methods to construct various SQL queries. 

8. SQLALCHEMY is one of the most popular python ORMs. It is a standalone library and has no association with FASTAPI. It can be used with 
any other Python web frameworks or any python based application. 

9.Remember, an ORM has the code for us to write Python, define all the models etc. But it doesn't actually know how to talk to a database.
It actually needs a database driver. 

Note for Myself: Understand the database.py commands for SQLALCHEMY to get a better understanding of how it is working.

Step 1: Create a database.py file to set up the connection with Postgres DB.

Step 2: Now we have to define our tables in models.py.

10. Session object is responsible for talking with databases. So, we created a function get_db in main.py where we actually 
get a connection to our database, or get a session to our database. And so everytime we get a request, we are going to get a session,
we are going to be able to send SQL statements to it. And after the request is done, we will close it out.
And we will keep calling this function everytime we get a request to any of our API endpoints. 

11. Now, for all of our path operations, where we want to perform some kind of operations on the DB, we are going to pass in another 
parameter inside the path function, and it's going to be - db:Session=Depends(get_db). This line is going to create that session to our 
DB, that we can perform some operations and then close it once that request is done. And then we can repeat the process for every single
one of our path operations. 

12. LIMITATION OF SQLALCHEMY:
SQLALCHEMY will generate your tables for the first time, that is, when the table is not present in the DB, based on the defined rules in 
the models.py. However, if the table already exists and if we update the table for anything, like acolumn addition etc. then SQLALCHEMY
is not going to touch it. So, it's not going to help us modify tables once it is created. We will have to delete it manually from the
Database and then run the python script again to create it in DB. 

13. Normally, when it comes to creating tables or when it comes to handling migrations, a term used for changing the columns or schemas
of the tables, then you want to use another software called ALEMBIC. 
SQLALCHEMY isn't really made for handling database migrations, we have to do it manually. 

14. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A SCHEMA/PYDANTIC MODEL AND ORM/SQLALCHEMY MODEL:
- See the screenshot 1 and 2 in folder difference between Pydantic models and SQLALCHEMY.
- Technically, we don't need Pydantic models. But when it comes to building out APIs, you want to be as strict as possible when it comes
to what kind of data can we receive and send to the user. And so Pydantic, just ensures that everything just matches up with what we 
expect.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------PYDANTIC MODELS DEEPDIVE----------------------------------

- We can have two different classes, that is, CreatePost and UpdatePost, for each specific request which is create and update posts 
respectively. And it's a perfectly valid use case because when it comes to creating the user should provide a certain amount of fields.
And updating it might be completely different. 

- Assume in our app, we want to make the update functionalu+ity in such a way that the user can't even update a post, they can update
only one property. For eg: published column in UpdatePost class. 

- How to send a Response back from FastAPI to the User?
Ans: We need to define a pydantic or schema model to define the exact shape of the response. And this is required since at times, we don'T
want to send all of the properties and attributes from our post table to the user. This is done to keep the information confidential from user,
so that he/she knows only what the user needs to know about, nothing else.
For eg: When a user logs in, we don't want to send back his password as a response. The user already knows his/her password.

- In Pydantic models, orm_mode=True will tell the Pydantic models to read the data even if it is not a dict, but an ORM Model(or any other
arbitrary object with attributes).

- model_dump(): This is the primary way of converting a model to a dictionary. Sub-models will be recursively converted to dictionaries. instead,
of orm_mode=true, we can use this option and it will convert any arbitrary object with attributes into a dictionary. And Pydantic models will
work well with this, since it knows only how to work with dictionaries. 

- Make sure to change the response_model code for GET ALL POSTS as you are trying to get the list of all posts. So, we will be using a LIST library
from optional package to convert the response_model into a list and send it back to the user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------CREATING USER FUNCTIONALITY----------------------------------

- User being able to create an account
- being able to log in
- create posts with specific to their account

- We will create a new path operation so that a user can actually send his username and password to our API and then we can actually
generate that user.

- Problem with ID in Users SQL ALCHEMY Table with inserting records from the application if there are users already present in the table.
Go the link to understand the issue: 
1. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37970743/postgresql-unique-violation-7-error-duplicate-key-value-violates-unique-const/37972960#37972960
2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40280158/postgres-sqlalchemy-auto-increment-not-working

- We never store the full password in the database, so we usually hash the password and store the hash of it in DB. Before we create the user,
we have to create the hash of the password.

- Using passlib[bcrypt] for hashing the password in DB. Moved the hashing logic in utils.py file.

- Get the USER by ID: Now we will set up a route or a path operation that allows you to fetch and retrieve information about a user 
based off their ID.
1. It can be a part of the authentication process. So depending on how we set up the frontend, if we decided to set up JWT tokens to get sent 
as cookies, then the frontend may not actually know whether it's logged in or not. 
2. And a lot of times you will see some APIs have an endpoint to let you kind of retrieve information about your own account. If you are 
able to access it, that means you are logged in. If not, then you need to fecth a new token.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------ROUTERS----------------------------------
--ROUTER INTORDUCTION:
What fastapi docs says about routers: If you are building an application or a web API, it’s rarely the case that you can put everything 
on a single file. FastAPI provides a convenience tool to structure your application while keeping all the flexibility.

- We will use Router object to split up all of our routes or path operations into different files and then we import them by calling
"app.include_router(post.router)" and then the specific router object of that file(mentioned in brackets).

- In this section, we will see how we can use Routers to actually split up all of our path operations so that we can organize our code a little 
bit better.

- Create a folder naking "routers" and create post.py and users.py files in it. Cut and paste the post routes in post.py and user routes in 
users.py file. Refactor the changes related to import of libraries and respective notebooks. Vscode does it automatically as well. 

- We will make a router object in users.py and post.py and replace the @app command with @router command. 

- Main reason for including a Router: When we get a HTTP Request, we will go in the main.py file and will encounter the first app object, which is
"post.router", which we have referenced. And that includes every router that is mentioned in the "post.py" file. Then the HTTP request will go
into the "post.py" file and "it's going to look into the Specific request match what the user has sent to the API and gets the response back
as the API normally does". And that's how we break out our code into separate files.

LOG INFO : INFO:     127.0.0.1:60108 - "POST /users HTTP/1.1" 307 Temporary Redirect- See and get info on this log info. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------JWT(JSON WEB TOKENS)(very very important)----------------------------------

- One of the most important topics when building out an API or any application is Authentication. There is 2 main ways to tackle authentication
when working for an API or for any application:

1. Session based authentication: The idea is, we store something on our backend server or API in this case, to track whether a user is logged in 
or not. So, there's some piece of information, whether we store it in database or in memory, that's going to keep track of "if the user has logged
in and when the user logs out."

2. JWT based authentication: The idea behind this is that it's stateless. What stateless means is, there's nothing on our backend, API or database
that actually keeps track or stores some sort of information whether a user is logged in or logged out. 

The power of JSON Web tokens is that the token itself is not stored in DB,API or backend. The token is actually stored on the frontends on our 
clients which actually keeps track of whether a user is logged in or not.

IMPORTANT POINT: 
So, we will have to see at the flow of how the user logs in, how a user is essentially authenticated, and then how a user 
accesses a specific path operation resource or endpoint by using the JWT to ensure that the API knows that we are logged in so that we can 
actually provide him that important information. 

WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN:
1. The user is going to try and log in. So, ultimately we are going to create a pth operation "/login" and the client is going to pass the email
and password. 
2. So, once we get the credentials, first we are going to verify whether the given credentials are valid or not. If the credentials match, then
we are going to create the JSON Web Token(JWT). REMEMBER, ONLY THE API CARES WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN THE TOKEN AND WHAT IT MEANS.
3. Once the token is created, then we will send a response back to the client with the token. And once the client has the token, he can start 
accessing the resources that require authentication. 
4. So let's say, our application requires a user to be logged in to retrieve posts. What the user can do, he will send a request to the "/posts"
endpoint, but he will also provide the token in the HEADER OF THE REQUEST. 
5. And what the API is going to do: First, it will verify if the token is valid. And there's a couple of different steps, which are needed to 
actually verify if a token is valid. And if the token is Valid, then the API just sends back the data. 
6. So the API doesn't actually track anything. There's no information being stored on the API. Instead, the client just holds on to the token. 
And the client provides the token to the API. And if the token is valid, then the necessary operation is performed. 


TOKEN DEEP DIVE: See the JW_Deep_dive_2not_encrypted_screenshot
1. The token is made up of 3 individual pieces: 

a) HEADER: It includes metadata about the token. So, we are going to sign this toke. Think about Hashing the token. So we have to specify the 
algorithm and the type of token we are going to use. 

b) PAYLOAD: The payload of the token is up to you(developers).You can send any piece of info that you want to send within the payload, you can 
include anything you want. However, you want to be careful with what you put in the payload because it's important to understand that the token
itself is not excrypted. And so that means anybody else in the outside world can take a look at the token, and they can see what's in the 
payload. So you don't want to put any confidential info, passwords etc. 

- So when we log in, our API is going to create a token and then embed our USER ID into the token. So that when we ask to get all of our posts,
the API will be able to take a look at the token, verify it's correct, extract to the payload, and it will automatically know the ID of the user
that requested this. 

c) SIGNATURE: Signature is a combination of 3 things: Header, Payload and Secret. So, there's a special passowrd that we are going to keep on 
our API. This is only know to API and no one else will know it. And it's probably the most important thing in our whole authentication
system. We essentially take 3 these 3 info: Header, Payload and Signature. Then we pass this info into the signing algorithm, which is HS256 and 
then it's going to return a signature. 
This signature is valid because we are going to use this signature to determine if the token is valid, because we don't want anyone else 
tampering with our tokens. This signtaure is here to make sure that no one has tampered with our specific token. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: The main points to note here:
1. There's no encryption in the above process. Anyone can see the data, the signature is just there for data integrity. And that means no one 
has tampered with the data and data in the token is intact. 


SIGNATURE DEEP DIVE: Why we need Signature within the token(see screenshot Purpose of Signature_3)
This signature only ensures that data integrity is still valid, that no one has tweaked any of the bits, no one's changed any of the data.
That's all the signatures can do. It can just verify that it hasn't been changed.


-----------------------LOGGING IN USER----------------------------------
- Here we will see how we are going to handle the logging in the user. More specifically, how do we actually verify that the user 
credentials are correct, because it's not going to be exactly the same way as we think.See the Logging in User screenshot 4.

- When the user hits the login endpoint, he is going to provide the login and password. When the user sends his password, it's just a regular
plain text.

- When the credentials hit the API, what happens is, the credentials hit the databases to try to find the user based off his email or his 
username. And the database is going to send all the info about that user, which includes the password. 

- However, when we created the logic for password, we have stored the HASH version of the password in the database so that if anyone hacks 
our database, they cannot crack the passwords.

- So now we have to compare the password given by the user which is in plain text and the hashed password present in the database.
How do we compare the two if they are equal? We will hash the password given the user in his attempt for login and will compare it with 
the hash password given in the database. If they are equal and correct, then the token for the user will be created and send it to the client. 

- Check the auth.py file for creating the functionality for log in of the user. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------CREATING THE TOKEN FOR THE LOGIN (VERY VERY IMPORTANT)----------------------------------

1. We need to install python-jose to generate and verify the JWT tokens in Python: pip install "python-jose[cryptography]"

2. Check the OAUTH2.py file for the full code implementation.

3. There will be 3 pieces of info for our token. There's also 3 other things about the token that we need to provide.  
SECRET_KEY, ALGORITHM that we want to use, Expiration Time of the token so that we can dictate how long a user should be logged in 
after they actually perform a login operation. 

4. We are going to define the function create_access_token. This function is going to have the payload. So whatever data we want to encode into 
the token, we have to provide that. We will pass a variable called data, which is of type dictionary.Go through the function to get the details
in oauth2.py. 

5. def login(user_credentials: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends(), db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
- By using OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends(), we are setting up a dependency kind of like we did with the databases. And this is going to 
require us to retrieve the credentials. And then FastAPI is automatically going to store it inside in the variable called "user_credentials".

6. NOTE TO REMEMBER: When we use the OAuth2PasswordRequestForm to retrieve the user's attempted credentials, it's going to store it in the field
called "username" and not the field called "email".

Summary: We learned how to log in a user by sending a request to the login endpoint and providing the username and password. And our API will
then return an access token, which the user can then use to retrieve the data from our API. So anytime he needs to access an endpoint that
requires a user to be logged in, he will just send this JSON WEB TOKEN in the payload and then our API has to actually validate the token.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------LOGIC FOR VERIFYING IF THE TOKEN IS STILL VALID----------------------------------

- This section discusses the logic for verifying if the token is still valid, the user has not tampered with it, as well as verifying that the 
token hasn't expired. 

- First, we have to define a schema for the access token and token type. We will also set up the schema for the token data so that the data we 
embedded into our access token, so we can say token data base model. 

- Create the function to verify the access token. Go through the function to get the details in oauth2.py. 

Summary:

1. Anytime we have a specific endpoint that should be protected, and that means that the user needs to be logged in to use it. 

2. Let's say, Users who want to be able to create the post, they need to be logged in. What we can do is we can just add the extra 
dependency into the path operation function. 

3. So in post_orm.py in create_posts, we are going add a dependency of user log in, in the create_posts path operation. 

4. So anytime anyone wants to access a resource that requires them to be logged in, we are going to expect that they provide an access token. 
And then we provide the login dependency, which is going to call the get_current_user function, then we pass in the token that comes from the 
request, then we are going to verify access token, and then it's going to provide all of the logic for verifying that the token is okay, and
there's no errors.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------FETCHING USER IN PROTECTED ROUTES---------------------------------------------

Q: Why do we have get_current_user function when we can directly call the verify_access_token function?
Ans: 1) The idea behind this function is that once the verify access token returns the token data, which is the ID, the get_current_user
    function should actually fetch the user from the database. And so that way we can attach the user to any path operation and then we can 
    perform any necessary logic. 
    
    2) So, get_current_user function is where you query your database to grab the user and then return the user. And then whatever you return 
    in the get_current_user function is ultimately what allows any of your other routes to get whatever you are returning from the function. 

- We can implement this in another way as well, where if we want each of our path operations to fetch the user themselves, they have the ID, 
so they can do it themselves. 

- We can also do it automatically within the get_current_user function as well. Kindly see the implementation in oauth2.py file.

VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: SEE THE POSTMAN ADVANCED FEATURES PART IN THE VIDEO FOR REVISION PURPOSE.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------SQL RELATIONSHIPS---------------------------------------------

- Here we have set up the Foreign key in table using SQLALCHEMY Method.

- As well as we have made changes accordingly in the code in models.py, schemas.py as well as in create_posts route of posts_orm to get the 
owner_id to the end user, so that the user knows which user has created the particular specific post he/she is fetching from the database.

-Added in posts_orm.py i0n create_posts route -      new_post = models.Post(owner_id=current_user.id, **post.model_dump())

- At this point, we have the authentication set up for DELETE and UPDATE post. However, there is no check to make sure that the user is DELETING
his own posts. Right now, anyone can delete anyone posts. 

- We will update the delete and update functionality where we will check that user only gets to delete their own posts and no one 
else.

- The command for that is given by as:     

    if post.owner_id != oauth2.get_current_user.id:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                                detail=f"Not authorized to perform requested action !!")


Q: What does the "relationship" keyword in the SQLALCHEMY models do?
Ans: 1. Whenever we will create a relationship between two classes in SQLALCHEMY, we will reference a defined class in another class in the 
models.py file. For eg: owner = relationship("User").

2. What this does is, it's automatically going to create another property for our post, so that when we retrieve a post, it's going to return 
an owner property. And whatit's going to do - It's going to figure out the relationship to user. So, it's actually going to fetch the user 
based off of the owner ID and return that for us. And there's nothing else we have to do.

3. One advatage of SQLALCHEMY is these relationships will automatically make it so that it fetches that data for us so that we don't have to 
manually do it ourselves. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------QUERY PARAMETERS---------------------------------------------

WEB ADDRESS : https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=San+Francisco%2C+CA

- Domain name - www.yelp.com. This is kind of like IP Address. 
- /search - This is the specific search endpoint that we want to reach. 
- But everything to the right of Question mark(?) is referred to as the QUERY PARAMETERS. 
- A Query Parameter is an optional key value pair that appears to the right of the question mark. And these query parameters allow us to filter
the results of a request.
For eg: If we are trying to retrieve posts, may be want the posts that have been created in the last 2 hours. May be, we want posts that 
have received over 100 likes etc. 
- These things can be done with the help of a query parameter, where we could just pass in a key and a pair, and can say, I want to find 
posts that are less than 2 hours old. 
- All those other operations in API like pagination, these things are going to be done with query parameters. 

- Limit and Skip functionality: Added limit and skip parameters in the get orm path function to retrive and skip the specific number of posts. 
- Search functionality: We should be able to search for the posts based on the words given in it. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES---------------------------------------------

- An environment variable is a variable that you configure on a computer. Doesn't matter the operating system, they all support it.
- And when you configure an environment variable on your computer, any application that's running on that computer will be able to 
access it. 

- We will have to perform some kind of validation to ensure that all of the right environment vairables have been set up to your application to 
actually run properly. And it's important to understand that when you read an ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE, it's always going to come out as a string
which is fine, but it just means that you have to do all of the validation in code. 
- We can use Pydantic to perform all of that validation for our environment variables. 
- Check config.py file in the main_files folder of the app. 
-Within the FASTAPI Directory, we will create a new file called ".env". This file is going to contain all of our environment variables.

- VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: To load the .env file in config.py use the below commands since class Config doesn't work to load .env file.
"from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()"

- You never check the .env file into git. Make sure to mention it in the gitignore file. 

- When we move to production, we can set of all the environment variables values on the machine inside the config.py file, and it's going to 
automatically import it and then update those values whenever we reference them. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------VOTING SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY IMPLEMENTATION---------------------------------------------
- Users should be able to like a post.
- Should only be able to like a post once.
- Retrieving posts should also fetch the total number of likes. 
- Refer to the screenshots as well as vote.py file for the implementation of this functionality.
- See the SQL Join part of this implementation of Postgres - VERY VERY IMPORTANT since you skipped it. 
- Check out the codes for routers get all posts and get one post to check the functionality implemented to get the post along with votes.
- We will need to implement the same functionality when implmenting with SQL Queries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------ALEMBIC MIGRATION IMPLEMENTATION---------------------------------------------

- LIMITATION OF SQLALCHEMY: SQLALCHEMY doesn't allow us to modify the tables, it doesn't allow us to create extra columns, delete columns, 
add Foreign key constraints. 
REASON BEHIND LIMITATION: When we define these models, what SQLALCHEMY does, it checks to see if the specific table name already exists in our 
PostgRes database, and if it does, it's not going to touch it. So if we make any changes, it will never push out those changes. It will 
create only those tables, if it doesn't already see a table with that specific name. 

ALEMBIC: It's a database migration tool that allow us to make incremental changes to our database and actually track it, kind of like what 
we do with the code. 

1. pip install alembic.

2. Initialized a new scripts directory for alembic using "alembic init alembic" command. alembic is the name of the new directory."

3.  Within the alembic folder , got o env.py file, where you have to add two things to make things work:
3.1 Because Alembic works with SQLALCHEMY, and the models you build with SQLALCHEMY, we need to make sure that it has access to our Base Object
in the models.py file. Change the Target_metadata=None to Target_metadata=Base.metdata . We atre doing to this to allow alembic to read all the 
models in the models.py file. 
3.2 To override the "sqlalchemy.url" path in the alembic.ini file, we will mention the sqlalchemy path the env.py file in alembic directory by 
importing config file from the app folder. 

4. Step by step process to setup tables in Postgresql using alembic:
4.1 In alembic, when we want to make a change in the database, so as to track all of the changes and modifications happening in the database, 
we create a revision file. 
- alembic revision -m "create posts table": This revision is going to be responsible for creating a post table. It will create a file under 
the versions folder. 
- in the file "create_posts_table.py" under versions folder, there are 2 functions upgrade and downgrade.
- Upgrade: When we run the upgrade, it runs the commands for making the changes that you want to do.So, we want to create a post table.
So we will put all of the logic for creating a post table within this function.  
- Downgrade: And if we ever want to rollback any of the changes we made, then we will have to put all of that logic in the downgrade function 
to handle removing the table. 

VERY VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: IAM FACING ISSUE WITH THE IMPORT OF BASE FROM MODELS.PY FROM MAIN_FILES DIRECTORY IN ENV.PY FILE IN ALEMBIC FOLDER.
STILL STRUGGLING TO FIND OUT HOW IT CAN BE RESOLVED. MOVING ON TO THE PART OF DEPLOYMENT AND TESTING.

----------------------------------------------CORS POLICY AND INITIAL GITHUB SETUP-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. CORS POLICY:

Q: What happens when we send a request to our API from a web browser insted of our own computer using Postman?
Ans: Use this command -> fetch('http://localhost:8000/').then(res=>res.json()).then(console.log) on Google Chrome -> inspect -> console. 

Definition: Cross Origin Resource Sharing(CORS) allows you to make requests from a web browser on one domain to a server on a different 
domain. By default our API will only allow web browsers running on the same domain as our server to make requests to it. 

2. SETTING UP GIT AND REPOSITORY FOR OUR CODE - VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT
- Before creating a git repo - save all the library versions in requirements.txt by using command - pip freeze > requirements.txt
- To install  the requirements.txt -> pip install -r requirements.txt

- First steps after the Git repository is created:
1. git init
2. git add README.md: instead of this we used "git add --all"
3. git commit -m "first commit". If for the first time you are using github then:
3.1: git config --global user.email "you@example.com" - SET UP YOUR EMAIL.
3.2 git config --global user.name "Your Name" - SET UP YOUR USERNAME. Then run the git commit -m "initial commit" command.
4. Set what our Branch is: git branch -M main
5. The we will have to set up the remote branch. 
This is what is going to allow us to store all of our code on GitHub: git remote add origin https://github.com/gauti1409/FastAPI_Project.git
6. This command means we are going to push all of our code upto github: git push -u origin main

To push changes into the current branch into the git: 
1. git branch - check current branch
2. git status - check the state of your codebase
3. git add. - add all untracke files
4. git commit -m "Write doen your message for the respective change made"
5. git pull origin main : where main is the name of the branch
6. git push origin main: where main is the name of the branch.
