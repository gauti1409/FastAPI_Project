1. To create a virtual environment for a project: py -3 -m venv venv_name
Note: venv_name is the name given to the virtual environment which can be anything. 

2. After creating virtual environment, remember to set the Python Interpreter path from virtual environment.
Steps: View > Cmd Pallete > Python Interpreter Path > Enter python.exe path and press enter.
Check on the right bottom that python from virtual environment is selected. 

3. To activate virtual environment use command in the Project directory: venv/Scripts/activate.bat

4. To deactivate the virtual environment, use command: deactivate

5. To install all dependencies of fastapi: pip install fastapi[all]

6. To run the live server in FastAPI: "uvicorn main:app". But if you change your code, to reflect those changes on the webpage, you will
have to restart the server.

7. To automatically reload the made changes without restarting the server, we will have to use the below command:
"uvicorn main:app --reload". This command can be used for a developer environment but not in the production environment since we won't be 
making changes to the production environment.

8. Till now we have been using our Web Brwoser to generate the HTTP requests to test our API.
But to test our APIs we can use the tool called as "Postman". Postman is a tool that just allows us to construct our own HTTP requests. 

9. pip freeze or pip list -> To see the list of all the packages installed. 

10. Before creating a git repo - save all the library versions in requirements.txt by using command - pip freeze > requirements.txt
- To install  the requirements.txt -> pip install -r requirements.txt

11. Commands for activating and removing a virtual environment:
- source venv/bin/activate
- pip freeze > requirements.txt
- pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y
- deactivate
- rm -r venv/

12. Use the command to run the Dockerfile: docker build -t fastapi . 
- Checking DOCKER IMAGE : docker image ls
- docker-compose up -d
- docker ps -a
- docker-compose down 
- docker-compose up --build
- docker logs fastapi-api-1
- docker image rm -f name_of_the_image
-Previous URL in the Postman : {{URL}}sqlalchemy_users

13. To run a script in terminal: py -3 .\tests\mytest.py
